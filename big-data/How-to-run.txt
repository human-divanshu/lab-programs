Running the command "hadoop classpath" will return the path of hadoop class files that are required to compile the java code that you have written for hadoop.

So, we will create an environment variable to this path by running following command.

export HADOOP_CLASS=$(hadoop classpath)

Now, environment variable HADOOP_CLASS holds the value of hadoop classpath. We have to now run java compiler on source code as given below:

javac -classpath ${HADOOP_CLASSPATH} WordCount.java WordCountMapper.java WordCountReducer.java

This will compile the java code and generate the .class files. Now you have to archive them into a jar. To do this, run the following command

jar -cvf WordCount.jar WordCount*.class

This will generate WordCount.jar which can be run on hadoop. You can run this file by typing the following command

hadoop jar wc.jar org.apache.hadoop.examples.WordCount /examples/wordcount/input /examples/wordcount/output

The output directory should not exist before execution. It will be created by hadoop.
